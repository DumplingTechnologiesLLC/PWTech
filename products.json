          "This innovative sludge dewatering product offers many advantages over conventional sludge management methods. Originally developed in Japan, the Volute Dewatering Press is patented worldwide, with more than 650 installations. The key to the process is the unique dewatering drum design. This drum is able to achieve both thickening and pressing (dewatering) of the sludge in a single, compact operation. It can take sludge as dilute as 0.1% solids, directly from a biological process, such as an oxidation ditch, and produce a cake of over 25% solids.
